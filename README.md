# Static Analyzer for Python Code

This Python application implements a static analyzer designed to perform quality checks and ensure coding standards. The analyzer covers several key areas to identify potential issues and improve code quality.

## Features

- Attribute Check: Validates function attributes for correctness.  
- Unreachable Code Detection: Identifies code that appears after a return statement.  
- Parameter Count Check: Ensures functions do not have more than three parameters.  
- Division by Zero: Detects potential division by zero errors.  
- Magic Number Detection: Identifies "magic numbers" in the code.

## Usage

### 1. Attribute Check
The analyzer performs two main tasks:

- **Function Signature Validation**: Checks if the function's signature contains specific attributes. Attributes are verified based on their position and type.
- **Value Check**: Ensures that attribute values meet specified criteria.

**Implementation:**

- Reads the code file line by line.
- Identifies function definitions and extracts function arguments.
- Checks the type and format of attributes.
- Validates attribute values based on specified rules.

**Example:**

```python
def example_function(int_param: int, str_param1: str, str_param2: str):
    pass
2. Unreachable Code Detection
This feature identifies lines of code that appear after a return statement.

Implementation:

Reads the code file to find return statements.
Checks if subsequent lines contain code that should not be executed.
3. Parameter Count Check
Ensures that functions do not exceed three parameters.

Implementation:

Counts the number of commas in function definitions.
Generates an error if a function exceeds the parameter limit.
Example:

python
Copy code
def many_params(a, b, c, d):
    pass
4. Division by Zero Detection
Detects potential division by zero errors.

Implementation:

Reads each line to find division operations.
Checks if the divisor is zero and generates an error message if so.
5. Magic Number Detection
Identifies magic numbers in the code.

Implementation:

Checks for direct comparisons with numbers, comparisons without meaningful context, or use of numbers in specific contexts.
Example:

python
Copy code
if value == 42:
    pass
Installation
